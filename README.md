A list of cool or useful resources to use for Software Engineering, Data Science, or anything else. Feel free to add anything with a PR. I have read/tried most of these but not all, so this also works as a book/article/tool recommendation tracker for myself.

These are mostly for my own reference. In case you read them and wonder 'why isn't X here?',  the answer is probably one of 2:
1. I don't know it exists. Please tell me about it!
2. It's very common/widespread and I don't think it needs mentioning.

Also, reminder for myself: Read the documentation first, second and last!
